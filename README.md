 Greedy algorithm -Easy level problem 

 WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

 There are two arrays- one with greed factor and other with cookies
 The children have the greed factor to satisfy them we need to provide them the cookies whoose size is greater than the greed factor.
 We return the maximum number of children who are satisfied.

 SOLUTION 
 Sort the two array  so that smallest cookie gets assigned to least greedy child.
 Take two pointer and start comapairing until condition fails.

 TIME COMPLEXITY- O(N log N+M log M+ M+N)  SORT AND WHILE LOOP
 SPACE COMPLEXITY-O(1) CONSTANT SPACE
